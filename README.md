# Graph Implementation in C++

This project provides a C++ implementation of a graph data structure. It supports both directed and undirected graphs and includes various algorithms for graph operations.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Supports both directed and undirected graphs.
- **Edge Insertion**: Methods for adding edges to the graph.
- **Graph Operations**:
  - **Connectivity**: Check if the graph is connected.
  - **Bipartiteness**: Check if the graph is bipartite.
  - **Eulerian**: Check if the graph is Eulerian.
  - **Cycle Detection**: Detect cycles in the graph.
  - **Connected Components**: Count connected and strongly connected components.
  - **Articulation Points and Bridges**: Find articulation points and bridges.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Perform depth-first search.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Perform breadth-first search.
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Compute the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's algorithm.
  - **Shortest Path**: Compute shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - **Maximum Flow**: Compute maximum flow in the graph.
  - **Transitive Closure**: Compute the transitive closure of the graph.
